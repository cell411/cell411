    <p><b>Crowdsource your Emergencies</b></p>
    <p>Cell 411 allows you to create custom cells or groups of your friends, neighbors or family
        members and alert them whenever you need help; they will receive your exact location with
        turn-by-turn directions to come and assist you. Whether you have a flat tire, you find
        yourself in danger or need medical assistance, you can leverage the power of large groups of
        trusted people to call for help and receive it. We even collaborate with public groups that
        allow entire cities, companies or neighborhoods to join and collaborate on solving
        emergencies in real time. </p><br>

    <p><b>Decentralized Organization</b></p>
    <p>Join, organize, and manage Cells of users all on your own, allowing you full control over
        what services and groups you want to have contact with.</p><br>

    <p><b>Fully Customized Alerts</b></p>
    <p>You can alert your friends when you need help or receive alerts when they need help, with
        directions to where you should go. Only people you specifically issue alerts to can see
        them.</p><br>

    <p><b>Built By and For Activists</b></p>
    <p>Police brutality, illegal searches and other government abuses can be broadcast out to your
        local cell with turn-by-turn directions to your location. </p><br>
